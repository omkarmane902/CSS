    <h1>Early history (1700s–1918)</h1>

    <i>See also: History of cricket in India to 1918
The British first brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, 
with the first cricket match played in 1721.[11] It was played 
and adopted by Kolis of Gujarat who were sea pirates and outlaws
 who often looted the British ships. The East India Company tried 
 to manage the Kolis through cricket and were successful,[12][13][14] 
 In 1848, the Parsi community in Mumbai formed the Oriental Cricket Club,
 the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow beginnings, 
  the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877.[15] By
   1912, the Parsis, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular 
   tournament with the Europeans every year.[15] In the early 1900s, some Indians
    went on to play for the England cricket team. Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji 
    and Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on 
    to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy – two major first-class tournaments 
    in India. In 1911, an Indian men's cricket team, captained by Bhupinder Singh of Patiala,
     went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams 
and not the England cricket team.[16][17]</i>

   Test match status (1918–1970) 
</h1>
<em>India was invited to the International Cricket 
    Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test
    playing nation in England in 1932, led by C. K.
      Nayudu, who was considered the best Indian 
      batsman at the time.[18] The one-off Test
       match between the two sides was played at
        Lord's in London. The team was not strong in 
        their batting[19] at this point and went on to
         lose by 158 runs.[</em>
